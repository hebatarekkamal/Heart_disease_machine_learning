# Heart_disease_machine_learning
Healthcare is a major domain where data mining techniques are widely used. If
you are curious about data mining projects in healthcare, you should explore the
heart disease dataset.

Dataset: The dataset contains 75 particulars of 303 people. These particulars
include parameters related to an individual’s heart health like age, gender, serum
cholesterol, blood sugar, etc.

The project implementation steps will go as follows:
• Understand the dataset attributes.

• Apply the required data cleaning methods.

• Implement different classification models to investigate the performance of
each classifier on heart disease datasets.

• Mention your observations and study the parameters that play a vital role
in determining the health condition of people’s hearts (ex. Gender-based
analysis, age-based analysis, ... etc.)
(What percentage of younger people are prone to be diagnosed with heart
disease?
Are women more prone to heart diseases, or is it the other way?.
